	1. SDLC
	 Key Phases of SDLC:
	*planning and requirement analysis
	*System Design 
	*Implementation
	*Testing
	*Deployment 
	*Maintenance and Support

SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle)** is a process used by software engineers and developers to design, develop, and test high-quality software. The key phases of SDLC are:

1. Planning and Requirement Analysis: 
   * This is the first and most crucial phase where project goals, scope, risks, and requirements are defined. It involves gathering inputs from stakeholders and understanding what the end-users expect from the software.

2. System Design:
   * During this phase, the software's architecture and system designs are created. This includes both high-level design (HLD) for the overall system architecture and low-level design (LLD) for detailed functional specifications.

3. Implementation:
   * Also known as coding, this phase involves translating the design documents into actual code. Developers write code using suitable programming languages and tools to create the software components.

4. Testing:
   * Once the software is developed, it is rigorously tested to ensure it meets the specified requirements and is free of defects. This includes unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and acceptance testing.

5. Deployment:
   * After testing, the software is deployed to the production environment where it becomes available to end-users. This phase may also involve installation, configuration, and initial user training.

6. Maintenance and Support:
   * This final phase involves ongoing support to fix issues, update the software to accommodate new requirements, and ensure the software continues to function smoothly over time. Maintenance activities include bug fixes, performance improvements, and updating the software to stay compatible with new hardware and operating systems

* Popular AGILE Frameworks:
Scrum: A framework that uses fixed-length iterations called sprints and includes roles such as Product Owner, Scrum Master, and Development Team.

Kanban: A visual workflow management method that focuses on continuous delivery and optimizing flow.

Extreme Programming (XP): A methodology that emphasizes technical excellence and practices such as test-driven development (TDD) and pair programming.
	
* CRLF- Carriage Return Line Field
* CORE VALUES OF AGILE MANIFESTO: Here are the four core values:

Individuals and interactions over processes and tools

Working software over comprehensive documentation

Customer collaboration over contract negotiation

Responding to change over following a plan
	
	* GIT CMDS:
	
	
	1. git -v: Displays the current version of Git installed.
	
	2. mkdir project1: Creates a new directory named `project1`.
	
	3. cd project1: Changes the current working directory to `project1`.
	
	4. echo 'Hello from first Project' >file.txt: Creates a file named `file.txt` and writes the text "Hello from first Project" into it.
	
	5. ls: Lists all files in the current directory, which shows `file.txt`.
	
	6. cat file.txt: Displays the contents of `file.txt`, which shows "Hello from first Project".
	
	7. git init: Initializes a new Git repository in the current directory.
	
	8. ls: Lists all files in the current directory again, showing `file.txt`.
	
	9. ls -a: Lists all files in the directory, including hidden files (shows `./`, `../`, `.git/`, and `file.txt`).
	
	10. git add file.txt: Stages `file.txt` to be committed to the repository. The warning indicates that line endings in the file will be converted.
	
	11. git status: Shows the status of the working directory and staging area. Indicates `file.txt` is staged for commit.
	
	12. echo 'Another file'>file2.txt: Creates another file named `file2.txt` and writes "Another file" into it.
	
	13. git status\: Shows the current status. Now it indicates `file2.txt` is untracked.
	
	14. **`git rm --cached file.txt`**: Removes `file.txt` from the staging area, making it untracked again.
	
	15. git status: Shows the current status. Both `file.txt` and `file2.txt` are now untracked.
	
	16. git add : Stages all untracked files in the directory, including `file.txt` and `file2.txt`. The warnings indicate line endings will be converted.
	
	17. git status: Shows the current status, indicating both `file.txt` and `file2.txt` are staged for commit.
	
	18.git commit -m 'Feature X completed: Commits the staged files with the message "Feature X completed". Provides information about the commit.
	
	19. ls -l: Lists all files in the directory with detailed information (permissions, owner, size, modification date).
	
	20. git log:
	   - This command shows the commit history in detail.
	   - In your case, it shows:
	     - Commit hash: `dc96c82d5c97c3754ead8f8d7354d9b6e5413442`
	     - Branch: `(HEAD -> master)`
	     - Author: `Manushree L <manushree.l@olamnet.com>`
	     - Date: `Tue Feb 11 15:51:14 2025 +0530`
	     - Commit message: `Feature X completed`
	
	21. git log --oneline:
	   - This command provides a simplified and concise view of the commit history.
	   - It shows each commit on one line with:
	     - Shortened commit hash: `dc96c82`
	     - Branch: `(HEAD -> master)`
	     - Commit message: `Feature X completed`
	
	* GIT CONFIGURATION
	
	
	Git configuration involves setting up parameters that control the behavior of your Git environment. You can configure these settings at different levels to customize Git's behavior for your specific needs. Here are the different types of Git configuration:
	
	1. System Configuration
	- **Description**: Applies to all users and repositories on the system. It is configured using the `git config --system` command and typically requires administrative rights to modify.
	- **File Location**: Located in the Git installation directory (e.g., `/etc/gitconfig` on Unix systems or `C:\Program Files\Git\etc\gitconfig` on Windows).
	  
	 2. Global Configuration
	- **Description**: Applies to all repositories for a single user. It is configured using the `git config --global` command.
	- **File Location**: Located in the user's home directory (e.g., `~/.gitconfig` on Unix systems or `C:\Users\<username>\.gitconfig` on Windows).
	
	3. Local Configuration
	- **Description**: Applies to a specific repository. It is configured using the `git config` command without any additional flags.
	- **File Location**: Located in the `.git` directory of the repository (e.g., `project/.git/config`).
	
	* Common Configuration Settings
	Here are some common Git configuration settings:
	
	- User Information:
	  - Set the name and email address for commits:
	  
	    git config --global user.name "Your Name"
	    git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
	 
	- Editor:
	  - Set the default text editor for Git (e.g., Vim, Nano, VSCode):
	    
	    git config --global core.editor "code --wait"
	
	- Line Endings:
	  - Configure how line endings are handled (important for cross-platform projects):
	    
	    git config --global core.autocrlf true   # Windows
	    git config --global core.autocrlf input  # macOS/Linux
	   
	- Aliases:
	  - Create shortcuts for commonly used Git commands:
	    
	    git config --global alias.st status
	    git config --global alias.co checkout
	    git config --global alias.br branch
	* Viewing Configuration Settings
	You can view your Git configuration settings at different levels using the following commands:
	- **System**: `git config --system --list`
	- **Global**: `git config --global --list`
	- **Local**: `git config --list`
	
	### Example
	Here's an example of setting up your Git configuration:
	```sh
	# Set global user information
	git config --global user.name "John Doe"
	git config --global user.email "john.doe@example.com"
	
	# Set global editor to VSCode
	git config --global core.editor "code --wait"
	
	# Set global alias for status command
	git config --global alias.st status
	\
	
	GIT PUSH 
	The `git push` command is used to upload local repository content to a remote repository. This command updates the remote branch with the changes you have made locally. Here's how you can use `git push`:

### Basic Syntax

git push [remote-name] [branch-name]

Example
If you have a remote named `origin` and you want to push changes to the `master` branch, you would use:

git push origin master


Step-by-Step Process
1. **Add Changes to the Staging Area:**
   
   git add .
  

2. **Commit the Changes:**
   ```sh
   git commit -m "Your commit message"
   ```

3. **Push the Changes to the Remote Repository:**
   ```sh
   git push origin master
   ```

### Pushing to a Different Branch
If you want to push to a different branch (e.g., `feature-branch`), you can specify the branch name:
```sh
git push origin feature-branch
```

### Force Push (Use with Caution)
If you need to forcefully push changes (overwriting the remote branch), you can use:
```sh
git push --force origin master
```
Be careful with this command, as it can overwrite changes in the remote repository.

### Push All Branches
To push all branches at once, you can use:
```sh
git push --all origin
```

By using `git push`, you ensure that your local changes are reflected in the remote repository. If you have any more questions or need further details, feel free to ask!
