Introduction to Database

A database is a structured collection of data stored electronically, allowing efficient data storage, retrieval, and management.

Types of Databases

1. Relational Databases (RDBMS)
   -  Store data in tables with rows and columns, related through keys.
   - Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL.

2. NoSQL Databases
   -  Handle unstructured or semi-structured data, offering flexibility and horizontal scalability.
   - Examples: MongoDB, Cassandra.

3. In-Memory Databases
   - Store data in RAM for extremely fast access.
   - Examples: Redis, SAP HANA.

4. Object-Oriented Databases
   - Store data as objects, similar to object-oriented programming.
   - Examples: db4o, ObjectDB.

5. Graph Databases
   - Use graph structures with nodes, edges, and properties to represent data.
   - Examples: Neo4j, Amazon Neptune.

6. Document-Oriented Databases
   - Store data as documents, typically in JSON or BSON format.
   - Examples: MongoDB, CouchDB.

7. Key-Value Databases
   - Store data as key-value pairs for simple and fast retrieval.
   - Examples: Redis, DynamoDB.

DBMS Architecture
DBMS architecture is typically divided into three levels:
1. External Level: User views of the database.
2. Conceptual Level: Logical view of the entire database.
3. Internal Level: Physical storage of data.

Types of Models
1. Hierarchical Model
2. Network Model
3. Relational Model
4. Object-Oriented Model

ER Model
- Entity-Relationship (ER) Model: Uses entities, attributes, and relationships to represent data.
- Components: Entities, Attributes, Relationships, ER Diagrams.

Keys in DBMS
- Primary Key: Unique identifier for records.
- Foreign Key: Ensures referential integrity.
- Composite Key: Multiple fields combined to form a unique identifier.
- Candidate Key: A field or set of fields that can uniquely identify records.

Normalization
- Organize data to reduce redundancy.
- Normal Forms: 1NF, 2NF, 3NF, BCNF, 4NF, 5NF.

Basic Operations of Relational Algebra
1. Select 
2. Project 
3. Union 
4. Set Difference 
5. Cartesian Product 
6. Rename 

SQL
- Structured Query Language for managing databases.

DDL, DML, DCL, DQL, TCL
- DDL (Data Definition Language)**: CREATE, ALTER, DROP
- DML (Data Manipulation Language)**: SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
- DCL (Data Control Language)**: GRANT, REVOKE
- DQL (Data Query Language)**: SELECT
- TCL (Transaction Control Language)**: COMMIT, ROLLBACK, SAVEPOINT

 Data Types in SQL
 - INT, VARCHAR, DATE, BOOLEAN, FLOAT.

ACID
-  Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability.

Stored Procedures
- Definition: Precompiled SQL code stored in the database for reuse.
