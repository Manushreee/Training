Cloud Computing Overview
Cloud computing is the delivery of various services over the Internet, including storage, computing power, databases, networking, software, and more.

 Characteristics
1. On-demand self-service: Users can access services whenever they need without human intervention.
2. Broad network access: Services are available over the network and can be accessed through various devices.
3. Resource pooling: Providers serve multiple customers with scalable resources that can be dynamically allocated.
4. Rapid elasticity: Resources can be quickly scaled up or down based on demand.
5. Measured service: Resource usage is monitored, controlled, and reported for transparency.

Deployment Models
1. Public Cloud: Services are delivered over the public Internet and shared across multiple organizations.
2. Private Cloud: Services are maintained on a private network and used by a single organization.
3. Hybrid Cloud: Combines public and private clouds, allowing data and applications to be shared between them.

Service Models
1. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): Provides virtualized computing resources over the Internet.
2. Platform as a Service (PaaS): Provides hardware and software tools over the Internet.
3. Software as a Service (SaaS): Delivers software applications over the Internet on a subscription basis.
